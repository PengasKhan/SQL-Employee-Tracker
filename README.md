# SQL Employee Tracker [![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)

## Description

Challenge 12 submission by Connor Ness. This challenge took the scenic route in how I completed it. I had bits and pieces of the right ideas, but too many express challenges before this one fried my brain a bit as to following the actual challenge requirements. I got my SQL all nice and tidy, and promptly went off the rails making routing that wouldnt be necessary. With the help of my tutor Phil Loy, though, I got it worked out.
